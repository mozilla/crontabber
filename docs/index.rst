crontabber
==========

Note (2021-09-07): This project is no longer maintained.

``crontabber`` is a cron job manager. Written in Python. Uses PostgreSQL for storage.

Killer features include:

* Retries jobs on failure automatically
* Dependency-aware, and wonâ€™t execute child jobs that depend on parents that
  have failed
* Nagios integration making it easy to monitor health of jobs

You start crontabber with ``crontab`` and internally it figures out which jobs
to run when and in what ideal order.

``crontabber`` requires Python 2.6 or Python 2.6 and PostgreSQL 9.2 or greater.
